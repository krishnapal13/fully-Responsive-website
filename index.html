          Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means
          helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think
          about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach
          ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out
          how to make it better. Education may help and guide individuals from
          one class to another. Educated people and groups can do things like
          help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.

        <p>
          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex
          institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is
          also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system,
          while informal education is unstructured learning through daily
          experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels
          that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
          education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the
          teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education,
          and on the subject, like science education, language education, and
          physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental
          states and qualities of educated people and the academic field
          studying educational phenomena.

          Non-formal and Formal education in India
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-formal education includes adult basic education, adult literacy
          education or school equivalency preparation. In non-formal education,
          someone who is not in school can learn to read, write, and other basic
          life or job skills. Home education, individualized instruction (such
          as programmed learning), distance learning and computer-assisted
          instruction are other possibilities.<br />
          Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic,
          academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or
          kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school
          and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or
          higher education) is usually at a college or university which may
          grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where
          they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to
          be plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These
          course have arrangements for students to get practical experience.
          Apprenticeship was the older way to do this
